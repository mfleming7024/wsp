<h1>Project Analysis</h1>
<div class="left_section">
<h2>Site Intent</h2>
<p>The plan behind the redesign of Mabu Comics website is to strip out various unneeded assets in order to make a more functional site. This in turn will attract more internet traffic and thus more business. By simplifying what we already have it will lead to a clearer visual flow in terms of what the user wants to do and how the website caters to the user. By analyzing the key user paths we can put more emphasis behind what the user wants to do and how efficient the website is in helping the user accomplish that task. Reducing and optimizing content will also lead to less server load and faster page load times which benefit both the business and the consumer.</p>

<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
<p>The website has virtually no web presence or analytical software built in so there is no sure way to determine how the site is running and who uses it. However, based on the site it appears that the targeted audience is males and females ranging from 18-44 years old in the United States and North America. Most of this age group is younger in the 18-25 years age group in college with no kids and one job. With a successful redesign of the site we will be able to appeal to even more from this demographic as well as others. </p>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>There is a vast market for comic book sales and that unfortunately means that there is an enormous amount of competition. When redesigning the site it will be important to appeal to the key demographic and also stand out from the competition through our design and function. Below is a list of the top competing sites.</p>
